# COVID-19-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Diagnosis of COVID 19 using Machine Learning 

# Overview:
This project predicts the likelihood of a person being COVID-19 positive based on symptoms and demographics using machine learning models. It helps prioritize testing in areas where RT-PCR tests are limited.

Technologies Used:

 -LightGBM

 -XGBoost

 -SHAP (for model interpretability)

 -StandardScaler (for feature scaling)

# Key Features:

 -Uses real patient symptom data

 -Headache identified as the most predictive symptom

 -SHAP beeswarm plots for explainability

 -High accuracy and classification performance

 -ROC and Precision-Recall curves for validation

# Model Evaluation:

 -Accuracy

 -Confusion Matrix

 -ROC-AUC

 -SHAP Value Analysis

# Conclusion:
The model performs well using minimal input and can assist healthcare systems in resource-constrained scenarios. It is especially useful for quick screening and prioritization.
